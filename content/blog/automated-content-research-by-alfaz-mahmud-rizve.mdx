You know you need to publish content to grow your SaaS or agency. But staring at a blank Google Doc while frantically searching for "trending topics" or scrolling through Twitter is not a strategy. It is a recipe for burnout.

Most content marketers and founders spend 80% of their time researching and only 20% writing. They get stuck in analysis paralysis, trying to find the "perfect" keyword. What if you could flip that ratio?

Welcome to **Day 15** of the **[30 Days of n8n & Automation](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/category/n8n-automation/)** series. In our previous posts[,](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/category/n8n-automation/) we have automated social media distribution and client onboarding. Today, we are going upstream to the source. We are going to build a system for **automated content research** that delivers high-value topics, keywords, and competitor data directly to your dashboard while you sleep.

I’m **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve**, and at **whoisalfaz.me**, we believe research should be a system, not a scavenger hunt. Let’s build your infinite strategy engine.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Why Automated Content Research Wins Deals

Manual research is slow, biased, and inconsistent. You might check Google Trends on Monday, forget on Tuesday because of a client fire, and spend three hours down a Reddit rabbit hole on Wednesday. This inconsistency kills momentum and leaves huge gaps in your content calendar.

**Automated content research** standardizes the intake of market intelligence. It ensures you never miss a trend because a robot is watching the market for you 24/7. It separates the *gathering* of ideas from the *execution* of ideas.

**Alfaz Mahmud Rizve has seen** agencies double their content output simply by removing the "what should we write about?" meeting from their weekly calendar. When you open your laptop on Monday morning, the ideas should already be there, sorted by potential impact and ready for production.

This workflow is perfect for:

- **SaaS Founders:** Monitoring feature requests, competitor changelogs, and industry complaints.

- **Agencies:** Generating endless topic lists for clients without billing manual research hours.

- **SEO Strategists:** Tracking keyword volume changes automatically without logging into Semrush daily.

## The Architecture: n8n + NewsAPI + Sheets

To build this engine, we need three core components: a Trigger (Time), a Source (Data), and a Destination (Storage). We aren't just dumping links; we are building a structured database of ideas.

### The Stack

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

At **whoisalfaz.me**, we use this exact stack to track low-code automation trends before they hit the mainstream media. It allows us to pivot our content strategy in real-time.

## Step 1: The "Wake Up" Trigger

We want this report ready before you log in. Consistency is the heartbeat of **automated content research**.

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

By setting this to run daily, you remove willpower from the equation. You don't "decide" to do research; the research happens to you.

## Step 2: Fetching Intelligence via API

Now, let's get the data. We will use an **HTTP Request** node to query an external API. For this tutorial, we will use `NewsAPI.org` as an example because it’s free for developers and easy to use, but you can swap this for the [Google Trends API via RapidAPI](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-use-google-trends-api/) or a keyword tool API.

**Configuration for HTTP Request Node:**

- **Method:** `GET`

- **URL:** `https://newsapi.org/v2/everything`

- **Authentication:** Header Auth (or Query Parameter depending on the API).

- **Query Parameters:**
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>`q`: `("SaaS marketing" OR "automation") AND "AI"` (Use boolean logic to get specific).

- `sortBy`: `popularity` (We want high-impact news).

- `language`: `en`

- `apiKey`: `[YOUR_API_KEY]`

</li>
</ul>

**Alfaz Mahmud Rizve's Pro Tip:** Be specific with your query. Broad keywords like "Business" return noise. Specific keywords like `"churn reduction" OR "customer retention"` return actionable insights.

Here is what the JSON output usually looks like:

JSON

```
{
  "status": "ok",
  "totalResults": 124,
  "articles": &#91;
    {
      "source": { "name": "TechCrunch" },
      "author": "Tech Writer",
      "title": "The Future of AI in 2026: What SaaS Founders Need to Know",
      "description": "As automation takes over, founders must pivot...",
      "url": "https://techcrunch.com/...",
      "publishedAt": "2026-01-03T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}

```

If you see this green output, you have successfully pulled raw intelligence from the web.

## Step 3: Cleaning and Deduplication

Raw data is messy. If you just dump 100 API results into a spreadsheet every day, you will hate using it. It will become a graveyard of links. We need to clean it up.

### Splitting the Item Lists

The API gives us a nested list (an array) of articles inside the `articles` object. n8n processes items, so we need to split this array.

- Add a **Split Out** node (formerly Item Lists).

- Field to Split Out: `articles`

Now, instead of 1 item with 100 articles, you have 100 items.

### The Deduplication Logic

You don't want to see the same article today that you saw yesterday. This is a common mistake beginners make.

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

This logic is critical. It ensures your **automated content research** dashboard remains a source of *fresh* inspiration, not stale news.

## Step 4: AI Enrichment (The Secret Sauce)

Here is where we add the real value. A list of links is okay, but a list of *angles* is better. We don't just want to know *what* is trending; we want to know *how* to write about it.

Add a **Google Gemini** or **OpenAI** node after your Merge node. We are going to process each new article through an LLM.

**The Prompt to use:**

> 
> 
"I found a trending article titled '{{$json.title}}' with this description: '{{$json.description}}'.

> 
> 
> 
> 
Please act as a SaaS Content Strategist.

> 
> 
> 
> 
> 1. $1
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 2. $1
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 3. $1
> 
> 
> 

Map the Output:

Use the Edit Fields (Set) node to clean up the AI response into separate fields:

- `AI Titles`

- `Outline`

- `Virality Score`

At **whoisalfaz.me**, this step saves us about 30 minutes of brainstorming per article. We don't start from zero; we start from a structured first draft.

## Step 5: The Final Dump to Google Sheets

Finally, map the enriched data to your Google Sheet. Your sheet headers should look like this:

<table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><td>**Date Fetched**</td><td>**Original Headline**</td><td>**Source**</td><td>**Virality Score**</td><td>**AI Suggested Angles**</td><td>**Outline**</td><td>**Status**</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Jan 03</td><td>AI Trends 2026...</td><td>TechCrunch</td><td>9/10</td><td>1. How to survive...</td><td>– Point 1...</td><td>To Do</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Alfaz Mahmud Rizve's Rule:** Always include a "Status" column with a dropdown menu (To Do, Ignored, In Progress). This turns your research sheet into a production Kanban board.
