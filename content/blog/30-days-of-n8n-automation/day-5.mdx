##  automations for SaaS & agencies (framework + examples) 

If you try to automate everything at once, you end up shipping nothing. The smartest way to start with automation is to pick **your first 3 automations for SaaS and agencies** that save real time, touch revenue, and are simple enough to ship this week.

In this post, **[Alfaz Mahmud Rizve](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/who-is-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)** shares a simple framework to pick your first automations for SaaS and agencies, plus concrete examples you can steal.

## The 3–3–3 rule for your first automations

Use this rule whenever you choose your **first automations for SaaS and agencies**:

- 3 places you lose time every week

- 3 workflows closest to revenue

- 3 constraints that keep it simple

This keeps your automation system focused and helps you avoid nerd‑sniping yourself with complex n8n builds.

## 1. 3 places you lose time every week

Look at the last 7–14 days and ask: *Where did we waste the most time on repetitive work?* Common answers for SaaS and agencies:

- Manually handling inbound leads from different forms and platforms

- Repeating the same client onboarding steps again and again

- Pulling the same metrics into Google Sheets for weekly reports

Write down your top 3 time sinks and roughly how many hours each one steals every week. This is the raw material for your **first automations for SaaS and agencies**.

## 2. 3 workflows closest to revenue

From that list, highlight the workflows that are closest to:

- New opportunities and demo calls

- Signed clients and paid subscriptions

- Renewals, upsells, and expansions

If a workflow directly affects leads, deals, or retention, it’s a prime candidate for your **first three automations**.

## 3. 3 constraints that keep it simple

For your first automations, **simplicity beats cleverness**:

- Only use tools you already have in your stack

- The workflow should fit in 3–5 clear steps

- You can test it end‑to‑end in under 30 minutes

If it needs 15 branches and 10 approvals, it’s not a “first automation for SaaS and agencies” – it’s a later‑in‑the‑series problem.

## The Event → Action → Outcome map

Before you touch n8n, define each of your **first automations for SaaS and agencies** in one sentence:

> 
> 
When **[event]** happens in **[tool]**, automatically **[action]**, so that **[outcome]** happens every time.

> 

Examples:

- When a new demo request is submitted on the website, automatically create a deal in the CRM and send a confirmation email, so that no lead is lost.

- When a new client signs a proposal, automatically create a project, assign tasks, and send an onboarding email, so that every client gets the same great start.

If **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** cannot write your automation in this one line, it’s not ready to build yet – and neither is yours.

## Example 1: Centralizing inbound leads (SaaS & agencies)

**Goal:** Every lead from forms, ads, and chat ends up in one place, fast.

**Event → Action → Outcome**

- Event: New lead arrives from any form (website, Typeform, ad lead form).

- Action: Normalize the data, create a contact/deal in your CRM, send an internal Slack/Email alert.

- Outcome: No lead slips through the cracks, and response time drops to minutes.

Why this is a perfect **first automation for SaaS and agencies**:

- Clear link to revenue (leads → meetings → deals)

- Simple pattern you can repeat for new sources

- Great intro to n8n triggers, basic data mapping, and notifications

## Example 2: Simple client onboarding sequence (agencies)

**Goal:** Turn “yes” into a smooth, automated onboarding.

**Event → Action → Outcome**

- Event: Deal marked as “Won” in the CRM.

- Action: Create a client folder/space, generate a checklist in your PM tool, send a welcome email with next steps.

- Outcome: Every new client gets a consistent onboarding without anyone copying templates manually.

This kind of automation is where **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** sees agencies get instant wins: fewer missed steps, fewer “sorry, forgot to send this” messages, more trust from day one.

## Example 3: Weekly KPI snapshot (SaaS & agencies)

**Goal:** Stop wasting Mondays on manual reporting.

**Event → Action → Outcome**

- Event: Every Monday at 9:00 (time‑based trigger).

- Action: Pull metrics from Stripe, your CRM, ad accounts, and helpdesk into a single summary.

- Outcome: You see the health of your SaaS or agency each week without touching a spreadsheet.

This is a safe, internal **first automation for SaaS and agencies** – if it breaks, only your team sees it, and you get great practice with APIs and data transformation.
