If you’ve decided n8n might be your new automation brain, the next question is: *where should this brain live—n8n Cloud or your own server?* In this Day 3 guide of [**30 Days of n8n & Automation**,](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/category/n8n-automation/) you’ll see the trade‑offs, get a quick setup path for both options, and leave with a checklist you can use to get n8n running on your SaaS or agency stack today.​

Along the way, **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** will point out a few real‑world tips from working with SaaS teams and agencies that don’t have time to babysit servers.​

## What is n8n in the context of your stack?

In case you landed here first: **n8n is a visual workflow automation platform** that lets you connect your tools, move data, and run logic without building a full backend every time. You create workflows by connecting nodes on a canvas, and those workflows can run on a server you control or on n8n’s own cloud infrastructure.​

That’s why the “cloud vs self‑hosted” question matters: the workflows are the same; where they run changes how you manage cost, security, and maintenance.​

## n8n Cloud: fastest way to start

If you want to try **what is n8n** without touching servers, n8n Cloud is the fastest route. You sign up, pick a region, and get a ready‑to‑use workspace where you can start building workflows in minutes.​

## When n8n Cloud makes sense

- You want to validate automations quickly before committing to infrastructure.

- Your team hates dealing with Docker, SSL, and backups.

- You prefer predictable pricing over managing your own VPS.​

## n8n self‑hosted: more control, more responsibility

Self‑hosting is where **what is n8n** meets “I like owning my infrastructure”. You run the same editor and workflows, but on a server you manage: a VPS, container platform, or on‑prem machine.​

## When self‑hosting makes sense

- You need strict data residency or compliance (keep data in your region or VPC).​

- You expect heavy usage and want to scale horizontally on your own terms.

- Your dev/ops team is comfortable with Docker and reverse proxies.​

## Minimal self‑host requirements

- A small VPS (for example 1–2 vCPU, 2–4 GB RAM) is enough for early workflows.​

- Docker + docker‑compose installed, or another container runtime.

- A domain/subdomain (like `n8n.yourdomain.com`) and HTTPS via a proxy such as Nginx or Traefik.​

## n8n Cloud vs self‑hosted: quick decision table

<table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Situation</th><th>Better fit</th><th>Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Testing **what is n8n** for the first time</td><td>n8n Cloud</td><td>No servers, fastest to get a workflow running.​</td></tr><tr><td>Solo founder / small team with no DevOps</td><td>n8n Cloud</td><td>Less maintenance, focus on workflows not infrastructure.​</td></tr><tr><td>Agency with many client automations</td><td>Often Cloud, sometimes self‑hosted</td><td>Cloud for speed; self‑host if clients require private infrastructure.​</td></tr><tr><td>SaaS with compliance / VPC requirements</td><td>Self‑hosted</td><td>Full control over data location and networking.​</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy workloads or custom scaling</td><td>Self‑hosted</td><td>Can fine‑tune resources and clustering.​</td></tr></tbody></table>

Whatever you choose, remember: workflows remain portable, so you can prototype on n8n Cloud and migrate to self‑hosted later if needed.​

## Quick start checklist for your stack

Here is a simple checklist **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** uses when helping SaaS teams and agencies adopt n8n:

## For SaaS products

- ✅ Choose n8n Cloud for fast validation; plan a self‑hosted instance later if compliance demands it.​

- ✅ Build one core workflow first: sign‑ups → CRM → Slack → email welcome.

- ✅ Add logging and error notifications so you know when something breaks.

## For agencies

- ✅ Use n8n Cloud to maintain separate workspaces per client where possible.​

- ✅ Standardize a set of “starter” workflows: lead routing, reporting, content publishing.

- ✅ Document which credentials belong to which client to keep things organized.

## For content / info products

- ✅ Start on n8n Cloud with schedule‑based workflows: content repurposing, newsletter prep, analytics snapshots.​

- ✅ Only move to self‑hosted if workflows become resource‑intensive or you want tighter integration with custom backends.

## How to keep going after setup

Once you’ve answered “where should n8n live?”, the next steps are about building reliable workflows: starting small, monitoring, and gradually automating the boring edges of your product or agency operations.​

If you want a done‑with‑you or done‑for‑you approach, **[Alfaz Mahmud Rizve](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/contact-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)** can help design your automation roadmap, choose between n8n Cloud and self‑hosted, and build the first workflows so your team can focus on shipping, not wiring.
