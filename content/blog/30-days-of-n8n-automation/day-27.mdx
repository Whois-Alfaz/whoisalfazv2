**Stop Missing Calls: Build a Smart AI Voice Bot with n8n (Step-by-Step)**

Welcome back to **Day 27** of the *30 Days of n8n & Automation* series here on `whoisalfaz.me`.

We have given our AI **[Vision (Day 15)](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/automated-content-research-by-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)**, **[Hands (Day 25)](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/n8n-ai-agent-tools/)**, and **[Memory (Day 26)](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/n8n-rag-tutorial/)**. But until now, our AI has been silent. It only lives in text boxes.

Today, we break the silence. We are building an **n8n AI Receptionist**.

**The Problem:** If you run an agency or a service business (like a plumbing or consulting firm), you miss calls.

- **Missed calls = Missed revenue.**

- Standard voicemail is a "black hole" (nobody listens to it).

- Hiring a human receptionist costs $3,000/month.

- Paying for Voice AI tools like **Bland AI** or **Air.ai** costs $0.20/minute (expensive).

**The Solution:** We will build a custom **n8n Voice Bot** that:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

5. $1

This is not a toy. This is a deployable **Bland AI alternative** that runs for pennies.

## **The Tech Stack (The Voice Pipeline)**

We are combining three powerful APIs to create this system.

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

*Prerequisites:* You need a **Twilio Account** and a purchased phone number ($1/month).

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## ** Step 1: The "Listening" Ear (Twilio Setup)**

First, we need to tell Twilio what to do when someone calls your number. We use **TwiML** (Twilio Markup Language), which is just XML for phones.

### **1. Create the Webhook**

- Create a new n8n workflow.

- Add a **Webhook** node.

- **Method:** `POST`.

- **Path:** `incoming-call`.

- *Copy the Production URL.*

### **2. Configure Twilio**

- Go to your **Twilio Console** > **Phone Numbers** > **Active Numbers**.

- Click your number.

- Scroll down to the "Voice & Fax" section.

- **A Call Comes In:** Select "Webhook".

- Paste your n8n Production URL.

- **Save.**

### **3. The Greeting (TwiML Response)**

Now, when Twilio hits n8n, n8n must answer.

- Connect a **Respond to Webhook** node to your trigger.

- **Respond With:** `Text`.

- **Body:** Paste this XML code:

XML

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Say voice="alice" language="en-US">
        Hi, you have reached Alfaz's AI Assistant.
        He is currently building automation workflows.
        Please state your name and how he can help you after the beep.
        I will analyze your message and alert him immediately if it is urgent.
    </Say>
    <Record action="https://n8n.your-domain.com/webhook/handle-recording" maxLength="30" playBeep="true" />
</Response>

```

**Critical Detail:** Look at the `<Record action="...">` tag. This tells Twilio: *"After the user finishes talking, send the audio file to THIS second URL."* You need to replace `your-domain.com` with your actual n8n instance domain.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Step 2: The "Thinking" Brain (Handling the Recording)**

Now we need to build that *second* webhook to catch the audio file.

### **1. Create Webhook #2**

- Add a new **Webhook** node (separate workflow or same canvas).

- **Method:** `POST`.

- **Path:** `handle-recording`.

### **2. Download the Audio**

Twilio sends the audio location in a field called `RecordingUrl`. We need to download the actual file.

- Add an **HTTP Request** node.

- **Method:** `GET`.

- **URL:** `{{ $json.body.RecordingUrl }}`.

- **Response Format:** `File` (or Binary).

- **Property Name:** `data`.

### **3. Transcribe (Whisper)**

Now we convert the MP3 into text.

- Add an **OpenAI** node.

- **Resource:** `Audio`.

- **Operation:** `Transcribe`.

- **Input Binary Field:** `data`.

- **Model:** `whisper-1`.

Now, your workflow has converted the voice *"I need a website built ASAP"* into the text string `"I need a website built ASAP"`.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Step 3: The "Analyst" (AI Classification)**

We don't want to be bothered by spam calls about "car warranties." We only want to know about money.

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Step 4: The "Speaking" Mouth (The Urgent Alert)**

This is the **Day 27 Promise**. If the call is urgent, we want n8n to **call us back** immediately.

1. $1

2. $1

**The Experience:** You are at dinner. Your phone rings. It's your AI. *"Alfaz, you have a new high-priority lead. John needs a website by Friday."* You excuse yourself, call John back, and close the deal.

## **Why Build Instead of Buy? (Bland AI vs. n8n)**

Many people ask: *"Why not just use Bland AI or Air.ai?"*

**1. Cost:**

- **Bland AI:** ~$0.20 per minute.

- **n8n + Twilio:** ~$0.01 per minute.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Twilio Inbound: $0.0085/min.

- Whisper API: $0.006/min.

- **Savings:** 95%.

</li>
</ul>

**2. Control:** With n8n, you own the data. You can save the transcript to Notion, send the lead to Salesforce, or trigger a Slack alert. With SaaS tools, your data is trapped in their dashboard.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Conclusion**

You have now bridged the gap between the digital and physical worlds. Your **n8n AI Receptionist** interacts with the real telephone network, filtering noise and surfacing value.

You have built a system that **Listens** (Whisper), **Thinks** (GPT-4), and **Speaks** (Twilio).

**What’s Next?** We have covered almost every major modality: Text, Images, PDF, and Voice. But we haven't touched **Video**. Tomorrow, on **Day 28**, we are going to build an **Automated YouTube Shorts Generator**. We will use n8n to script, visualize, and render a video automatically.

**See you in the workflow editor.**
