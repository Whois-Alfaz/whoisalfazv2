Welcome back to **Day 28** of the *30 Days of n8n & Automation* series here on `whoisalfaz.me`.

We have reached the final tier of automation.

Over the last 27 days, we have mastered text, data, images, and voice. We gave our AI **[Vision](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/n8n-ai-receptionist/)**, **[Hands](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/n8n-ai-agent-tools/)**, [**Memory**,](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/n8n-rag-tutorial/) and [**Speech**.](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/automate-personal-branding-with-n8n/)

But today, we conquer the medium that rules the internet: **Video.**

## **The Problem: Why Video Editing is a Trap**

The Content Treadmill is Dead – Buildi a "Faceless" Video Factory with n8n If you are trying to build a personal brand or grow an agency, you have heard the advice: *"You must post vertical video daily."*

TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts are the only reliable way to get organic reach in 2026. But the production process is a prison.

To make a single 30-second "Faceless" video (the kind with a voiceover, stock footage, and captions), a human editor must:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

That is **4 hours of work for 30 seconds of content**. This is unscalable.

## ** The Solution: Programmatic Video**

As an Automation Architect, I refuse to do manual labor that a machine can do better.

Today, we are going to build an **Automated Video Factory**. We will build a workflow where you simply feed it a text topic—like *"3 Mind-Blowing Facts About Mars"*—and the system will output a fully produced `.mp4` file ready for upload.

This is not "AI Video" in the sense of Sora or Runway (which generate weird, morphing pixels). This is **Programmatic Video**: using code to assemble high-quality assets (images, text, audio) into a structured template.

It is reliable, brand-safe, and infinitely scalable.

## **The Tech Stack (The "Director's Suite")**

To manipulate pixels with code, we need a specialized rendering engine. FFMPEG is too complex for rapid iteration, and tools like Canva lack a true API.

We will use the **"Agency-Grade" Video Stack**:

## **Step 1: The Screenwriter (GPT-4 JSON Mode)**

The biggest mistake beginners make is asking ChatGPT to "Write a script." It returns a block of text with emojis and scene directions like *"[Camera pans left]"*. This breaks automation.

We need **Structured Data**. We need the AI to return a strictly formatted JSON object that separates the *spoken words* from the *visual instructions*.

>

You are an expert viral content scriptwriter for YouTube Shorts.

> 
> 
> 
> 
The user will provide a topic. You must generate a concise, 30-second script.

> 
> 
> 
> 
You must return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:

>

JSON

>

```
{
>   "title": "A punchy 3-5 word title for the video overlay (e.g., 'The Mars Mystery')",
>   "script": "The full spoken voiceover script. Keep it under 60 words. No scene directions.",
>   "image_prompt": "A highly detailed, cinematic DALL-E 3 prompt for a background image that matches the topic. Aspect ratio 9:16. No text in the image.",
>   "keywords": "comma, separated, tags, for, youtube"
> }
> 
```

> 

**The Logic:**

By separating `script` and `image_prompt`, we can send them to different workers (TTS and DALL-E) simultaneously.

**Test It:**

Input: *"The history of Bitcoin."*

Output:

JSON

```
{
  "title": "Bitcoin: The Digital Gold",
  "script": "In 2009, an anonymous creator named Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin...",
  "image_prompt": "A golden digital coin glowing on a dark futuristic circuit board, cybernetic style, vertical composition...",
  "keywords": "bitcoin, crypto, finance, history"
}

```

## **Step 2: The Art Department (DALL-E 3)**

A video needs visuals. We could use stock footage APIs (like Pexels), but they are often generic. Generative AI allows us to create unique, branded visuals every time.

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

5. $1

6. $1

**Output:**

The node will return a **Public URL** (e.g., `oaidalleapiprod...`).

*Note:* This URL expires after an hour. This is fine because we will render the video immediately.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Step 3: The Template (Creatomate Setup)**

This is the most "technical" part of today's build, but also the most powerful. We need to tell the rendering engine *where* to put our assets.

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

**What just happened?**

You created an API endpoint that accepts JSON like `{ "Background": "url...", "Title": "Text..." }`.

Creatomate will take that JSON and auto-adjust the video duration, subtitle timing, and animations to fit.

**Save** your template. Copy the **Template ID** and your **API Key**.

## **Step 4: The Director (n8n Orchestration)**

Back in n8n, we bring it all together.

### **The "Voice" Secret**

You might be wondering: *"Where is the audio file?"*

Creatomate has a built-in Text-to-Speech engine. By passing the text into the `Script` field (if your template is set up for it), Creatomate will automatically:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

*Advanced Option:* If you want to use ElevenLabs for better voices, you would generate the audio in n8n first, upload it to a server, and pass the Audio URL to Creatomate. For today, we stick to the internal TTS for simplicity.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Step 5: Distribution (Upload to YouTube)**

A video sitting on a server generates $0 revenue. We need to ship it.

The Creatomate node returns a JSON object containing a `url` ending in `.mp4`.

## **Advanced Strategies: Making It "Agency-Grade"**

The workflow above creates a solid "MVP" video. But to sell this to clients, you need polish.

### **1. Multi-Scene Videos**

A single static image for 30 seconds is boring.

- **Fix:** Ask GPT-4 to generate *three* image prompts (`image_1`, `image_2`, `image_3`).

- **Creatomate:** Set up your template with 3 scenes. Map the images sequentially. This increases retention massively.

### **2. Background Music**

A video without music feels empty.

- **Fix:** In Creatomate, add an "Audio" element set to "Loop." Upload a royalty-free lo-fi track. This ensures every generated video has a vibe.

### **3. Brand Watermarking**

- **Fix:** Add a logo image in the corner of your Creatomate template. Now every video is branded automatically, whether it's for your agency or a client.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Use Cases: The "Content-as-a-Service" Model**

This workflow is a goldmine for agencies. You stop selling "hours of editing" and start selling "Assets."

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## ** Conclusion**

You have just built a machine that converts **Ideas** into **Assets**.

This workflow changes the economics of content creation. It decouples "Output" from "Time." You can now test 10 different video concepts for the cost (and time) of one.

**What’s Next?**

We have built incredible separate systems: Research, Support, Content, Video.

But they are all disconnected. Your Voice Bot doesn't talk to your Video Bot.

Tomorrow, on **Day 29**, we are going to build the **"Master Orchestrator."** We will combine *everything* we have learned into a single **"AI Operating System"** (AIOS) that manages your entire digital life from one dashboard.

**See you in the workflow editor.**
