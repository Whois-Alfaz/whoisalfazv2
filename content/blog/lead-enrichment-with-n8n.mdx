If you are collecting leads but only storing name and email, you are leaving money on the table. **Lead enrichment with n8n** lets you automatically attach company, website, and location data the moment a lead enters your system.[](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-lead-generation/)​

In this Day 11 guide of [30 Days of n8n & Automation](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/category/n8n-automation/), you will learn how to call an enrichment API from n8n, map the response back to your CRM or Google Sheet, and ship a production-ready workflow.​

Throughout this article, examples come from real workflows that **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** uses for SaaS and agency clients at **whoisalfaz.me**.[](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/essential-n8n-core-nodes-by-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)​

## Why lead enrichment with n8n matters

When leads arrive with only an email address, sales teams waste time researching basics like company size, website, and city. Automated **lead enrichment with n8n** handles this grunt work in the background.​

For SaaS founders and agencies, this means:

- Better routing (e.g., high-ARR accounts straight to senior reps).[](https://n8n.io/workflows/12067-enrich-company-data-in-google-sheets-with-companyenrich/)​

- Smarter personalization in outbound and onboarding emails.[](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-lead-generation/)​

At whoisalfaz.me, **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** treats enrichment as a baseline: no lead should enter a pipeline without at least company, website, and location attached.[](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/essential-n8n-core-nodes-by-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)​

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## What you will build (Day 11 workflow)

In this Day 11 entry of **30 Days of n8n & Automation**, you will build a workflow that:

- Listens for new leads (from forms, imports, or a Google Sheet).[](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-lead-generation/)​

- Calls a **lead enrichment API** using the email or domain.​

- Returns company name, website, and location fields.​

- Writes the enriched data back into your CRM or spreadsheet.​

By the end, you will have a reusable **lead enrichment with n8n** template that you can clone for multiple brands or clients.​

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Choosing the right enrichment API

You can use any enrichment provider that exposes a REST API and returns JSON.​

Popular options include:

- Firmographic APIs (e.g., company size, industry, location, website).​

- IP-based enrichment to turn anonymous traffic into company profiles.[](https://www.leadfeeder.com/ip-enrich-api/)​

When **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** designs workflows at **whoisalfaz.me**, the selection process usually follows this rule:

- Start with one API that has a generous free tier.[](https://www.leadfeeder.com/ip-enrich-api/)​

- Confirm it supports your primary identifier (email, domain, or IP).​

Even if you later swap providers, your **lead enrichment with n8n** structure can stay identical—only the HTTP Request configuration changes.​

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Core nodes you will use (building on Day 6)

Day 6 of this series already covered the **essential n8n core nodes** like HTTP Request, Set, Merge, and Code.[](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/essential-n8n-core-nodes-by-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)​

In this **lead enrichment with n8n** workflow, you will primarily use:

- **Trigger node** (Webhook, Google Sheets, or CRM trigger).​

- **HTTP Request** to call the enrichment API.​

- **Set** to clean and normalize fields (company, website, location).​

- **If** to handle missing or failed enrichments.​

- Optional **Code** node for tiny transformations or fallbacks.​

This structure is almost identical to production workflows **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** uses for client lead pipelines at whoisalfaz.me.​

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Step-by-step: basic lead enrichment with n8n

![Interface view of an HTTP Request node in n8n configured to call a lead enrichment API using email and domain, along with a Set node that maps response fields into enriched_company, enriched_website, enriched_city, and enriched_country. The image supports a tutorial by automation consultant Alfaz Mahmud Rizve on whoisalfaz.me demonstrating lead enrichment with n8n for SaaS and agencies, and visually guides readers on how to structure their API call and normalization steps](/images/blog/lead-enrichment-with-n8n-Generated-Image-December-30-2025-11_37PM.webp)

This section walks through a minimal yet production-ready **lead enrichment with n8n** workflow where input and output live in Google Sheets.​

## 1. Prepare your input sheet

Create a Google Sheet with columns like:

- email

- first_name

- last_name

- company_input (optional)

- domain_input (optional)

- enriched_company

- enriched_website

- enriched_city

- enriched_country

A sample “Enrich Company Data in Google Sheets” setup is documented in n8n’s official workflows, where the enrichment API fills revenue, employee count, and location fields.[](https://n8n.io/workflows/12067-enrich-company-data-in-google-sheets-with-companyenrich/)​

At **whoisalfaz.me**, **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** often also adds a `status` column (“pending”, “enriched”, “failed”) to keep tracking clean for agencies managing many leads.[](https://n8n.io/workflows/12067-enrich-company-data-in-google-sheets-with-companyenrich/)​

## 2. Trigger: Google Sheets or Webhook

Use one of two patterns for **lead enrichment with n8n**:

- Google Sheets trigger: fires when a new row is added or updated.[](https://n8n.io/workflows/12067-enrich-company-data-in-google-sheets-with-companyenrich/)​

- Webhook trigger: form tools (Typeform, HubSpot, Webflow, etc.) call n8n when a lead submits.[](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-lead-generation/)​

For non-technical teams, the Google Sheets trigger is easiest, while SaaS products usually prefer a webhook-based approach.​

## 3. Build the HTTP Request node

Add an **HTTP Request** node and configure it roughly like this:

- Method: `GET` or `POST` (depends on your API).​

- URL: provider endpoint, for example a “match & enrich” or “company enrich” URL.​

- Authentication: API Key in Header (`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`).[](https://n8n.io/workflows/12067-enrich-company-data-in-google-sheets-with-companyenrich/)​

- Query/body parameters: pass email or domain from the incoming item.​

Many APIs return fields like `company_name`, `website`, `location_city_name`, and `country`.​

Once the node works for one sample lead, **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** recommends saving these settings in an n8n credential to reuse them across multiple **lead enrichment with n8n** workflows.​

## Example JSON mapping (pseudo)

```
json`{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "company": "Example Inc",
  "website": "https://example.com",
  "location": {
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "country": "United States"
  }
}
`
```

This structure matches common enrichment responses where company, website, and location are grouped in a single payload.​

## 4. Normalize data with Set (and optional Code)

After the HTTP Request node, add a **Set** node to map API fields into clean property names:​

- `enriched_company` ← `company_name`

- `enriched_website` ← `website`

- `enriched_city` ← `location_city_name`

- `enriched_country` ← `location_country_name`

In Day 6’s core node article, using Set earlier made workflows cleaner and easier to debug, and that pattern applies strongly in **lead enrichment with n8n**.[](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/essential-n8n-core-nodes-by-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)​

Optionally, add a small **Code** node to:

- Force lowercase domains.

- Strip tracking parameters from URLs.

- Combine `city` + `country` into `location_label`.

n8n’s documentation shows how code nodes are often just a few lines of JavaScript, even for AI-driven enrichment patterns.​

## 5. Write enriched data back

Finally, send the enriched fields to your storage:

- Google Sheets “Update” node to fill the enrichment columns.[](https://n8n.io/workflows/12067-enrich-company-data-in-google-sheets-with-companyenrich/)​

- CRM nodes (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce) to update contact/company records.[](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-lead-generation/)​

Official n8n workflow examples often use domain as a unique key to match rows and update only specific columns (like revenue, employees, and location).​

For SaaS and agencies, **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** suggests always writing a `last_enriched_at` timestamp to help you later manage retries or changes in provider quality at whoisalfaz.me.​

## Handling failures and avoiding API waste

Raw **lead enrichment with n8n** is not enough; you must handle:

- Missing data.

- Rate limits.

- Expensive calls on repeated leads.​

## Use If nodes for basic branching

Insert an **If** node just after HTTP Request to check whether the API returned a valid company.​

For example:

- If `company_name` exists → go to Set and write out.

- Else → mark as `status: "no_match"` and skip writing enrichment.

This simple branching pattern appears in many n8n templates, especially those doing multi-step enrichment or scraping.​

## Add simple caching

To avoid repeated calls, **lead enrichment with n8n** workflows often:

- Store enriched data in a sheet or database keyed by domain.​

- Check “Do we already know this domain?” before calling the enrichment API.​

Community workflows show how using a separate “cache” sheet or table significantly reduces cost while keeping enrichment fresh.​

At whoisalfaz.me, **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** uses a habit: “Never enrich the same domain more than once in 24 hours unless debugging.”​

## Real-world example: from form submission to enriched lead

Here is how a full production **lead enrichment with n8n** pipeline might look for a SaaS free-trial signup.​

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

5. $1

6. $1

n8n’s lead-generation examples show how this style of workflow can also include AI steps to score or classify the enriched lead before routing.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-F6Kycr5JE)​[](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-lead-generation/)​

This end-to-end pattern is exactly what **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** deploys for agencies that want qualified leads in their CRM instead of raw form submissions, and these are documented workflows at whoisalfaz.me.​

## Mistakes to avoid when enriching leads with n8n

There are a few classic traps that kill the ROI of **lead enrichment with n8n**:

- Calling the API too early: Enrich after you are sure the lead is valid (e.g., email verified).[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-F6Kycr5JE)​[](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-lead-generation/)​

- Ignoring rate limits: Most enrichment APIs enforce limits, and n8n workflows should respect these using built-in controls.​

- Not mapping fields consistently: Inconsistent field names across workflows make downstream analytics painful.​

Official workflow guides often recommend centralizing your enrichment fields (e.g., always `company_name`, `website`, `location_city_name`) to align multiple pipelines.​

**Alfaz Mahmud Rizve’s** personal rule at **whoisalfaz.me**: “If a field is important enough to enrich, it is important enough to standardize.”​

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Reusable enrichment framework for SaaS & agencies

You can treat **lead enrichment with n8n** as a reusable pattern that always follows the same steps:​

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

5. $1

6. $1

n8n’s workflow library shows multiple enrichment templates that follow exactly this pattern, only swapping in different enrichment or scraping providers.​

At whoisalfaz.me,[ **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** ](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/who-is-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)encourages agencies to standardize this framework so that every new client gets the same reliable enrichment backbone with minimal setup time.​

## Checklist: ship your lead enrichment with n8n

Use this quick checklist before you call the workflow “done”:

-  Defined a single identifier (email, domain, or IP) for enrichment.​

-  Configured a working HTTP Request node against your chosen API.​

-  Used Set to normalize `company`, `website`, and `location` fields.​

-  Added an If node for failed or empty responses.​

-  Updated storage (Google Sheets or CRM) with enriched fields.​

-  Implemented basic caching to avoid unnecessary repeated calls.​

-  Logged or notified high-value enriched leads for faster follow-up.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-F6Kycr5JE)​[](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-lead-generation/)​

This checklist mirrors the production workflows that official n8n examples use for company enrichment and AI-assisted pipelines.​
