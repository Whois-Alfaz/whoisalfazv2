<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

Every Monday morning, SEO professionals, agency owners, and SaaS founders face the exact same ritual. You log into Ahrefs, Semrush, or Moz, holding your breath to see if your "money keywords" went up or down.

These platforms are engineering marvels, but they charge you a steep "lazy tax." Paying **$99 to $199 per month** just to track 50 or 100 keywords is a massive overhead for a lean startup or a boutique agency. You are essentially paying a premium for a pretty dashboard when the raw data actually costs pennies.

Here is the dirty secret of the SEO industry: **Most rank tracking tools are just wrappers around the same APIs you can access yourself.**

What if you could build your own **automated rank tracker tool** that runs on autopilot, costs $0/month (thanks to generous free tiers), and sends the data exactly where you need it?

Welcome to **Day 16** of the [**30 Days of n8n & Automation** series](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/category/n8n-automation/). In our previous post [(Day 15](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/automated-content-research-by-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)), we built an [automated content research engine](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/automated-content-research-by-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/) to find what to write. Today, we are building the scoreboard. We will create a fully custom **automated rank tracker tool** using n8n, SerpApi, and Google Sheets that rivals the expensive SaaS competitors.

We will architect a fully custom **automated rank tracker tool** using **n8n**, **Serper.dev**, and **Google Sheets**. This isn't a toy project; this is a scalable system capable of tracking hundreds of keywords for free.

I’m **[Alfaz Mahmud Rizve](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/who-is-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)**, and at **whoisalfaz.me**, we believe you should own your data, not rent it. Let’s build your custom SEO engine.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Part 1: The Economics of "Build vs. Buy"

Before we open n8n, let's look at the math. Why bother building this?

Most SaaS rank trackers charge based on "keyword credits." If you want to track 500 keywords daily, you are pushed into the $199/mo tier. But if you buy that data directly from a SERP (Search Engine Results Page) provider, the cost is trivial.

### The Cost Comparison (Per 1,000 Searches)

<table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><td>**Solution**</td><td>**Cost**</td><td>**Notes**</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>**Ahrefs / Semrush**</td><td>**$99 – $199/mo**</td><td>Includes other tools you might not use.</td></tr><tr><td>**Wincher / Nightwatch**</td><td>**$49/mo**</td><td>Cheaper, but still a monthly recurring cost.</td></tr><tr><td>**Serper.dev (Direct API)**</td><td>**$1.00**</td><td>You pay per 1,000 searches. First 2,500 are free.</td></tr><tr><td>**SerpApi (Direct API)**</td><td>**$0.00 – $50**</td><td>Great for non-Google engines (Bing/Yahoo).</td></tr></tbody></table>

By building this **automated rank tracker tool**, you unlock three massive advantages:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Part 2: The Architecture & Tech Stack

We aren't just connecting two apps; we are building a data pipeline.

**The Stack:**

- **n8n:** The orchestrator. It handles the scheduling, looping, and logic.

- **Serper.dev:** The "Eyes." This is a high-speed Google Search API built for LLMs and scrapers. It is faster and cheaper than traditional proxies.

- **Google Sheets:** The "Database." We will use it to store our keyword list and our historical data.

- **Looker Studio (Optional):** The "Dashboard." We can connect our Sheet to Looker to give clients a live link (more on this later).

The Workflow Logic:

Trigger (Monday 9AM) → Read Keywords from Sheet → Loop (Batch of 1) → Call Serper API → Find URL Position → Calculate Change → Save to History → Aggregate Results → Send Slack Alert.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Part 3: Prerequisites & Setup

Do not skip this. The success of your automation depends on proper authentication.

### 1. Get your Serper.dev API Key

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

### 2. Prepare Google Sheets

Create a new Google Sheet. You need **two specific tabs**:

**Tab 1 Name: `Keywords`**

- **Row 1 Headers:**
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Column A: `Keyword` (e.g., "n8n automation")

- Column B: `Target URL` (e.g., "whoisalfaz.me")

- Column C: `Location` (e.g., "us", "uk", "bd") – *Crucial for local SEO.*

- Column D: `Device` (e.g., "desktop" or "mobile")

</li>
</ul>

**Tab 2 Name: `History`**

- **Row 1 Headers:**
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Column A: `Date`

- Column B: `Keyword`

- Column C: `Rank`

- Column D: `Change`

- Column E: `URL Found`

</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Part 4: Building the Engine (Step-by-Step)

![n8n workflow diagram visualized, showing the Split In Batches loop logic used to iterate through keywords and hit the Serper.dev API for automated rank tracking.by Alfaz Mahmud Rizve at whoisalfaz.me](/images/blog/build-an-automated-rank-tracker-tool-with-n8n-unnamed-29.webp)

Open your n8n editor. Let's build this node by node.

### Step 1: The "Wake Up" Trigger

Rankings fluctuate hourly, but tracking them that closely is noise. A weekly check is standard for reporting.

- **Node:** Schedule Trigger

- **Settings:**
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>**Trigger Interval:** `Weeks`

- **Weeks Between Triggers:** `1`

- **Time:** `Monday` at `09:00 AM`

</li>
</ul>

### Step 2: Read Your Keyword Database

We need to pull the list of what to track.

- **Node:** Google Sheets

- **Operation:** Get Many Rows

- **Sheet ID:** (Select your sheet)

- **Range:** `Keywords!A:D`

- **Output:** Ensure "Data is contained in" is set to "JSON".

### Step 3: The "Split in Batches" Loop

This is the most critical technical concept. We cannot send 100 keywords to the API instantly—we need to process them one by one (or in small batches) to handle the data correctly and avoid rate limits.

- **Node:** Split in Batches

- **Batch Size:** `1`

*Connect the "Google Sheets" node to this "Split in Batches" node.*

### Step 4: The Serper.dev API Call

Now, inside the loop, we hit the API.

- **Node:** HTTP Request

- **Method:** `POST`

- **URL:** `https://google.serper.dev/search`

- **Authentication:** Generic Credential Type -> Header Auth.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>*Name:* `X-API-KEY`

- *Value:* Paste your Serper API Key.

</li>

<li>**Send Body:** Turn toggle ON.</li>

<li>**Body Parameters (JSON):**JSON`{ "q": "{{$json.Keyword}}", "gl": "{{$json.Location}}", "hl": "en" } `*(Note: Drag and drop the `Keyword` and `Location` from the Input Data panel to make them dynamic variables).*</li>
</ul>

<img src="image_10.png" alt="n8n workflow diagram showing the Split In Batches loop logic for processing multiple keywords in an automated rank tracker tool." style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

### Step 5: Parsing the JSON (The Intelligence)

The API returns a huge JSON with "organic", "peopleAlsoAsk", "relatedSearches", etc. We need to find *our* ranking.

- **Node:** Code (JavaScript)

- **Goal:** Scan the top 100 results for our `Target URL`.

**Copy/Paste this Logic:**

JavaScript

```
// Input variables from previous nodes
const organicResults = items&#91;0].json.organic;
// We need to access the original keyword data from the SplitInBatches node context
// In n8n, this usually requires referencing the specific node or ensuring data flow
const targetUrl = $('Split in Batches').item.json&#91;'Target URL']; 

let rank = "100+"; // Default if not found
let foundUrl = "Not Found";

if (organicResults) {
  for (let i = 0; i < organicResults.length; i++) {
    // Check if the link contains our target domain
    if (organicResults&#91;i].link.includes(targetUrl)) {
      rank = organicResults&#91;i].position;
      foundUrl = organicResults&#91;i].link;
      break; // Stop the loop, we found it!
    }
  }
}

return {
  json: {
    rank: rank,
    found_url: foundUrl,
    checked_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    keyword: $('Split in Batches').item.json&#91;'Keyword']
  }
}

```

### Step 6: Calculating "The Change" (Delta)

Knowing you are #5 is good. Knowing you were #9 last week (so you went up +4) is better.

To do this, we need to look up the *last* time we checked this keyword.

- **Node:** Google Sheets (Get Many Rows)

- **Sheet:** `History`

- **Logic:** This is complex to do purely in n8n without a database query.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>*Simpler Alternative for V1:* Just record the rank. Let Google Sheets handle the delta calculation using a formula like `=C2-C3`.

- *Advanced Alternative:* Use the "Google Sheets – Lookup" node to find the last row matching the keyword and subtract the values.

</li>
</ul>

For this tutorial, we will append the data and let Sheets handle the visualization.

### Step 7: Saving the Data

- **Node:** Google Sheets (Append)

- **Sheet:** `History`

- **Mapping:** Map the fields from the Code node (`rank`, `found_url`) to the columns.

### Step 8: The "Wait" (Politeness Policy)

Never hammer an API.

- **Node:** Wait

- **Amount:** `1` Second.

- *Connect this back to the input of the "Split in Batches" node to close the loop.*

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Part 5: The Notification System

Once the loop finishes (the "Done" output of the `Split in Batches` node), we want a summary.

We don't want 50 emails. We want one digest.

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## Part 6: Visualizing Data (The Pro Tip)

Raw data in Sheets is ugly. Let’s make it look like a $200 SaaS.

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

Now you have a dynamic, interactive dashboard you can share with clients via a simple link. They see their rankings improve, and you didn't pay a cent for software.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

**[Alfaz Mahmud Rizve](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/who-is-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)** advises watching out for these specific issues when building your automated rank tracker tool:

- **The "100+" Trap:** If your rank consistently says "100+", verify your `Target URL` in the Sheet. If you entered `https://whoisalfaz.me` but Google indexes `https://www.whoisalfaz.me`, the string match might fail. Use just the root domain (e.g., `whoisalfaz`) to be safe.

- **Location Bias:** If you track "plumber" without a location, Google gives you generic results. If your client is in London, the generic US results are useless. Always use the `gl` (Geo Location) parameter (e.g., `uk`, `bd`, `ca`).

- **Mobile vs. Desktop:** Rankings differ wildly by device. Serper.dev defaults to Desktop. If you are a B2C brand, mobile is more important. You can change this in the API body logic.

- **Multi-Engine Tracking:** Serper.dev is Google-only. If you need **Bing, Yahoo, or YouTube** rankings, you must swap the API node for **SerpApi**. Note that SerpApi's free tier is lower (100 searches/mo), so use it sparingly for secondary engines.
