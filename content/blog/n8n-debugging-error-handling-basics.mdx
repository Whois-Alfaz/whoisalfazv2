## **The Reality of Production Workflows**

You've built a beautiful n8n workflow. It works in tests. It works when you click "Execute." But at 2 AM, your client's data sync fails silently, and you don't know until they complain three days later.

This is where **n8n debugging and error handling** separates hobbyists from professionals. **[Alfaz Mahmud Rizve](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/who-is-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/)** has seen workflows that looked perfect fail in production because no one set up proper error handling. This post teaches you how to catch, log, and fix those issues before they become disasters.

By the end of Day 7 of the [30 Days of n8n & Automation series](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/category/n8n-automation/), you'll know:

- How to read **n8n debugging logs** like a pro

- Why **retries matter** and how to set them up

- How to send **real-time alerts** to Slack and email when things break

This isn't theory. These are patterns **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** uses for every production automation at whoisalfaz.me.

## **Part 1: Understanding n8n Debugging Logs**

Every workflow run creates logs. Most people never look at them. That's a mistake.

## **Where to find your logs**

In n8n:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

That error message is your **n8n debugging clue**. It tells you:

- Which node failed

- What input it received

- Why it failed (missing field, API error, timeout, etc.)

## **Real example: API call failure**

Let's say your HTTP Request node fails with:

```
text`Error: 401 Unauthorized
`
```

This means your API credentials are wrong or expired. Without **n8n debugging**, you'd spend hours guessing. With it, you know in seconds: re-check your API key.

**Pro tip from [Alfaz Mahmud Rizve](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/who-is-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/):** Always check **node output** before moving to retries or alerts. 80% of issues are caught here.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **The 5 Most Common n8n Debugging Scenarios**

When building **n8n debugging workflows**, expect these errors:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

5. $1

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Part 2: Retries – Your First Line of Defense**

A retry automatically runs a failed node again, usually after a short delay. This catches temporary failures (API hiccup, network blip, temporary overload).

## **How to set up retries in n8n**

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

## **When retries work**

Retries are gold for:

- Rate-limited APIs (they recover after a few seconds)

- Flaky network calls

- Temporary timeouts

## **When retries DON'T work**

Don't waste retries on:

- Auth failures (wrong API key won't magically fix itself)

- Data validation errors (malformed email won't become valid on retry)

- Missing required fields

**Alfaz Mahmud Rizve's rule:** If a human would get the same error on retry, retries won't help. You need error handling instead.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Part 3: Error Handling – Catching and Routing Failures**

Retries are good, but they fail eventually. When they do, you need **error handling** to decide what happens next: log it, notify, or retry a different way.

## **The Try-Catch pattern**

This is the most powerful **n8n debugging pattern**. Here's how:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

## **How to build Try-Catch in n8n**

n8n doesn't have a visual "Try-Catch" node, but you can simulate it:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

## **Real workflow example**

Let's build a simple but powerful **n8n debugging workflow**:

**Scenario:** Sync leads from a form to your CRM. If the sync fails, log it and alert the team.

**Nodes:**

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

5. $1

This workflow ensures **no lead is lost** – even if the CRM fails, you have a log and know about it.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Part 4: Real-Time Alerts – Slack & Email**

When an error happens, silence is your enemy. **Real-time alerts** keep you in the loop.

## **Option 1: Slack Alerts (fastest)**

Slack is usually the best choice because:

- Instant notification to your phone

- Team can see it immediately

- Easy to thread and discuss

**Setup:**

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

```
text`Workflow: Lead Sync Failed
Error: API returned 500
Lead Email: {{$json["email"]}}
Time: {{$now.toISO()}}
Action: Check CRM status, retry manually if needed
`
```

**Pro tip from [Alfaz Mahmud Rizve](https://whoisalfaz.me/blog/who-is-alfaz-mahmud-rizve/):** Use message formatting with bullet points so your team can scan it quickly.

## **Option 2: Email Alerts (persistent record)**

Slack is great, but emails create a record and work even if Slack is down.

**Setup:**

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

```
text`Workflow: {{workflow_name}}
Error: {{error_message}}
Node: {{failed_node_name}}
Time: {{execution_time}}
Details: {{full_error_stack}}

Next steps:
1. Check logs in n8n dashboard
2. Verify API credentials
3. Retry manually if it's a temporary issue
`
```

## **Option 3: Combined Alerts (best)**

For critical workflows (lead sync, billing, client data), send BOTH Slack + Email:

- Slack for **immediate awareness**

- Email for **persistent record**

This ensures **Alfaz Mahmud Rizve**'s principle: **visible failures are fixed; hidden failures are disasters.**

## **Part 5: Building Your First Production-Ready Workflow**

Let's bring it all together. Here's a **real n8n debugging workflow** you can copy for your SaaS or agency:

## **The workflow: "Client Onboarding with Error Handling"**

**Goal:** When a deal is won in your CRM, automatically create a Notion page, send an email, and add to a Google Sheet. If anything fails, alert Slack and log it.

**Nodes (in order):**

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

**Error Handler (if Notion fails):**

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

4. $1

This workflow ensures:

- ✅ **Visibility:** Team knows immediately if onboarding fails

- ✅ **Recoverability:** Nothing is silently lost; all failures are logged

- ✅ **Audit trail:** Google Sheets has a record of every attempt and error

**Alfaz Mahmud Rizve** uses this pattern for every client-facing workflow at whoisalfaz.me.

## **Checklist: Is Your Workflow Production-Ready?**

Before you deploy any **n8n debugging workflow**, check:

-  **Retries enabled** on all API calls (3 retries with exponential backoff)

-  **Error handling** for every risky node (HTTP Request, database writes, API calls)

-  **Slack alert** for critical failures (lead loss, payment failure, data sync broken)

-  **Email alert** sent to admin with full error context

-  **Logging** to Google Sheets or database of all failures

-  **Manual retry option** (a button or workflow to re-run failed records)

-  **Tested with bad data** (test how it handles null fields, API errors, timeouts)

If you can check all of these, your workflow is production-ready.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

## **Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)**

**Mistake 1: Retrying forever**

Don't set max retries to 100. You'll waste API quota and look like a bot. **3–5 retries is standard.**

**Mistake 2: Silent failures**

A workflow that fails silently is worse than no workflow. **Always add alerts.**

**Mistake 3: Not logging errors**

You forgot what went wrong last week? **Always log to Google Sheets or a database.**

**Mistake 4: Catching errors but doing nothing**

If you catch an error, handle it. Slack the team, email admin, or retry differently. **Silent catches = hidden disasters.**

## **How This Fits Into 30 Days of n8n & Automation**

By Day 7, you now understand:

- How to read **n8n debugging logs** to find problems fast

- How to use **retries** for temporary failures

- How to build **error handling** workflows that catch and notify

- How to send **real-time alerts** to Slack and email

The next posts in this series will show you how to apply these patterns to real-world automations: lead handling, client onboarding, reporting, and more.

Every workflow you build from here on should follow the patterns you learned in **n8n debugging and error handling**. This isn't extra work—it's the difference between automation that works and automation that creates silent disasters.
