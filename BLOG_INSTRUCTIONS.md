# SOP: Blog Refurbishment Workflow

This file is the single source of truth for refurbishing and posting blogs in the "30 Days of n8n & Automation" series. Read this **EVERY TIME** before starting a blog task.

## 1. Filename Policy
- **NEVER** change the existing filename of an MDX file once it is established (e.g., `day-5.mdx`).
- Do not use the slug as the filename. Stay with the sequential `day-X.mdx` format for easier navigation.

## 2. Frontmatter Rules
- **Slug**: Must match the user's provided slug exactly (e.g., `automations-for-saas-and-agencies`).
- **Date**: Set the current real-world date of the task.
- **Image**: Verify the file exists in `/public/images/blog/` before setting the path.

## 3. Content Integrity & Day Correction
- **Sequential Context**: Always scan the content for "Day X" references. 
- **Verbatim + Fixes**: Keep the user's provided text but **correct** logical errors (e.g., if it's Day 5, ensure it says "Day 5 Mandate" and "Tomorrow, in Day 6").
- **Highlighting**: Apply **bolding** to key tools and insights for readability.

## 4. Structural Hierarchy & Spacing
- **Heading Spacing**: ALWAYS leave exactly one empty line before and after a heading (`##` or `###`).
- **Section Dividers**: Use the horizontal rule component exactly as shown in Day 1: `<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>`. Ensure it has one empty line above and below.
- **Image Placement**: Use the standard markdown syntax for images: `![Alt Text](/images/blog/filename.webp)`. Add one empty line before and after the image.
- **Bullet Points**: Use consistent indentation and spacing for nested lists.

## 5. Affiliate Link Integration
Intelligently embed affiliate links within the narrative for all the affilate list given and mentioned in the blog.
- **CTA Highlighting**: ALWAYS bold the primary call-to-action link for an affiliate (e.g., **[Get started with Tool →](URL)**).
- **Descriptive Links**: Use descriptive text for links rather than just the URL or generic "click here".

Example Affiliate Links:
- **n8n**: `https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/ch585gsqzanp`
- **Vultr**: `https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9859101-9J`
- **Apollo**: `https://get.apollo.io/bs1ny1i5eigv`
- **Monday.com**: `https://try.monday.com/66vrkkiezhrz`
- **Brevo**: `https://get.brevo.com/6b88c13841c4`
- **Databox**: `https://join.databox.com/qfzdqmwp7elc`

## 5. Mandatory "Deploying the Stacks" Section
Every post **MUST** end with a dedicated "Deploying the Stacks" section before the final Strategy Call CTA. Use separate `###` headers for each tool mentioned in the post.

Example Format:
```markdown
## Deploying the Stacks
[Brief intro about the tools used today]

### 1. The Engine: [n8n](...)
[Description]
[CTA Link]

... [Repeat for others] ...
```

## 6. Verification Checklist
- [ ] Filenames unchanged?
- [ ] Slug matches user request?
- [ ] Day numbers are mathematically correct (Today = X, Tomorrow = X+1)?
- [ ] All 6 potential affiliate links checked?
- [ ] "Deploying the Stacks" section included?
- [ ] SSG Build passes (`npx next build`)?
