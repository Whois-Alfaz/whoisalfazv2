> **"Control. Connect. Conquer."**  
> The central nervous system for my digital existence. A high-performance, headless architecture designed to showcase the future of automation, AI, and faceless business systems.

## 🚀 Mission

I help agency owners and entrepreneurs escape the **"Content Treadmill"** and build systems that run on autopilot. This repository (`whoisalfaz-v2`) is the frontend for my personal brand, serving as both a portfolio and a laboratory for my experiments in **AI Agents**, **n8n workflows**, and **CashOps**.

## 🏗 Headless Architecture

This project splits the traditional monolithic CMS into a high-performance **Frontend** and a flexible **Backend**.

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[WordPress Backend] -- GraphQL API --> B(Next.js Frontend)
  B -- React Server Components --> C{User Experience}
  D[n8n Automation] -- Webhooks --> A
  E[AI Agents] -- Chat Interface --> B
```

### 1. The Brain (Backend)
- **CMS**: WordPress (Headless Mode)
- **API**: WPGraphQL
- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean Droplet (`v1.whoisalfaz.me`)
- **Role**: Manages content, media library, and SEO metadata. It is completely decoupled from the frontend design.

### 2. The Face (Frontend)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Custom Design System (Dark Mode / Glassmorphism)
- **Deployment**: Dual-Remote Pipeline (GitHub + DigitalOcean)
- **Role**: Renders the UI, manages routing, and hosts interactive tools (ROI Calculator, AI Chat).

## 📦 Deployment Protocol

**Command:**
```bash
npm run push-all
```
*Effect*: Pushes code to both `origin` (GitHub backup) and `deploy` (Live DigitalOcean server) simultaneously.
